#Ambient battle
Simulate an ongoing battle in the distance without being limited to audio simulation of arma.
The program will spawn battle sounds randomly chose but snyched between players in the specified distance in the direction of the module. this will cause the player to always hear gun sound coming from the modules position, even when he is further away than the simulation would allow (600-700m+). 
The origin position of the sounds is positioned for each player, so there will be no conflicts.
## further planned features
- tracers
- explosion (sounds and lights)
