# Ambient battle
## Details
Simulate an ongoing battle in the distance without being limited to audio simulation of arma.
The program will spawn battle sounds randomly chose but snyched between players in the specified distance in the direction of the module. this will cause the player to always hear gun sound coming from the modules position, even when he is further away than the simulation would allow (600-700m+). 
The origin position of the sounds is positioned for each player, so there will be no conflicts.
## Usage
Release 0.1 can be used as a script saved inside the mission folder.
Any later versions are editor placeable modules. The module allows you to specifiy the paramters like distances, amount of gunfire etc. Place the module where the battle is supposed to happen. Synch it to a trigger, once the trigger activates, so will the module.
## further planned features
- tracers
- explosion (sounds and lights)
